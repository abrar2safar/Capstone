# Capstone project :

we worked as a team of 3 on forcasting stock market .. as the first step for an AI trader .. 

A trader is a person or entity - machine in our case â€“ which buys and sells financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, commodities, derivatives, and mutual funds.

The goal of stock traders is to capitalize on short-term market events to sell stocks for a profit, or buy stocks at a low. Some stock traders are day traders, which means they buy and sell several times throughout the day the scope of the project is to predict the stock market data using Artificial Intelligence then study the prediction efficiency.

In the field of Data Science problem solving is the building base for every step in the project sequence and sometimes we create our own problems. In this project there is no Actual problem rather than a simple prediction of the pattern.

Artificial Intelligence Traders definitely will interest financial driven individuals and corporations for the liquidation it would make with minimal efforts and emotionless decisions.

Profit/loss ratio is the golden measure as a success metric for the whole project plus the model specific scoring measures. As Tadawul is the sole entity authorized in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to act as the Securities Exchange, and is also the official source of all market information, A neat csv file includes all the market information was acquired.

The potential challenges might vary from Data acquisitions, features extraction, model architecture, model accuracy, and deployment.
