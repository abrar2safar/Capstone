Some stock traders are day traders, which means they buy and sell several times throughout the day the scope of the project is to predict the stock market data using Artificial Intelligence then study the prediction efficiency.

## Problem statment 

In the field of Data Science problem solving is the building base for every step in the project sequence and sometimes we create our own problems. In this project there is no Actual problem rather than a simple prediction of the pattern.

## Scope 

Profit/loss ratio is the golden measure as a success metric for the whole project plus the model specific scoring measures. As Tadawul is the sole entity authorized in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to act as the Securities Exchange, and is also the official source of all market information, A neat csv file includes all the market information was acquired.

The potential challenges might vary from Data acquisitions, features extraction, model architecture, model accuracy, and deployment.

## Summary
